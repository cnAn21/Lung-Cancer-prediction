# Lung Cancer Prediction 🫁

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset is derived from a lung cancer survey and includes various risk-related factors such as age, smoking, and anxiety levels.

Two Jupyter Notebooks are provided:
- **Lung_cancer_V.ipynb** – Basic model implementation
- **Lung Cancer Prediction.ipynb** – Enhanced version with additional preprocessing and SMOTE balancing
